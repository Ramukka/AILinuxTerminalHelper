#Linux Terminal Helper#
by Rami "Ramukka" Niemenmaa 2025

This python script is a little tool to help you with terminal commands
in Gnu/Linux.

When set up correctly you can use it by just typing "helper" followed by your prompt in the terminal window.

You can either use the included setup tool, or set it up manually
by instructions in manual-installation.txt

run the setup tool by opening a terminal window in this folder and running
'python setup-tool.py'

NOTE: keep all the files in the same 'linux-terminal-helper' directory. If the directory is moved elsewhere, the 'helper' command won't work anymore. You can use the setup tool to automatically update the new location.

you need your own Google Gemini API key to use this program.
